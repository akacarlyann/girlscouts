<h1>My Pets</h1>
<h2> By Abigail Newton</h2>

<p>Oh... Uh... Erm... Hi there. Oh. You want to hear about my pets? Wow I'm popular. Or wait... Are my pets popular...? Anyways, lets get into it, then!</p>
 
<p>How about we start with my three month old kitten!</p>

<h3>Purrcy the Kitten</h3>
<p>Purrcy, my kitten, has a white and black coat. He has a black heart on the left side of his body. We adopted him from the SSPA. He had a few siblings, too. He's pretty crazy and furious when he plays. He's super cute and funny. Purrcy was named after a Harry Potter prefect, Percy Weasly. Purrcy sleeps with his humans, he doesn't usually sleep in his cat bed. He <b>loves</b> breezes. His favorite types of toys are fake tails. To be honest, Purrcy kind of looks like he has a Hitler mustache, not gonna lie.</p>

<h3>Nagini My First Snake</h3>
<p>Nagini is a champange ball python. Currently she is eating frozen rats. She loves to roam. Unfortunatly, she doesn't poop in her tank, though... Nagini is a half year old or so and she loves to explore. She is usually very inquisitive and energetic. She also knows when its feeding day. (the day she eats rats.) She loves hiding. Her nickname is Fatty McFaterson because she <b>LOVES</b> eating. She is named after Voldemort's snake in Harry Potter.</p>

<h3>Salazar My Second Snake</h3>
<p>Salazar is named after Salazar Slytherin, also a character in Harry Potter. He is a pastel pewter ball python. He is also currently eating rats. Salazar also likes roaming around. He can be pretty energetic and inquisitive, too. Salazar poops in his tank, fortunatly. Salazar is a lot like Nagini. He too <b>loves</b> hiding. He's also about half a year old.</p>

<p>My snakes are very sweet and like cuddling. They <b>never</b> bite, unless they feel very threatened, if they're being attacked, or if they're eating. Snakes are very cute, too. Purrcy is kind, but sense he's a kitten he's a little too fierce sometimes. People completely misunderstand snakes. They're one of the kinded creatures I know. Although, do not handle a snake for about two days, depending on the size of the snake and prey. They will throw up and, in other words, die. Snakes and kittens sounds like a cool movie name, too!</p>

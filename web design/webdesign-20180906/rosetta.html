<h1> Rosetta's Web Page About Bettas</h1>
<h4> This is Rosetta's first website.
Im Rosetta, Ill be helping you take care of bettas by giving you edvice. This is a website about how to take care of your betta. First of all  your betta will need food.  About 4-6 pelots a day. If your betta's bowl gets durty then you put the betta into a sepret bowl, then clean it's own bowl.  Fish that get pop eye will need medicen. Do not give them gel it makes it worse. Instead use some liqued (used for healing fish of pop eye) to cuire the fish. Don't try to breed bettas, put bettas in one tank, or have bettas make freinds. Or you will end with a dead fish! My fishs are named Star Dust and Moon Dust. Star Dust's tale is so heavy it ways him down to the buttom to the tank. He only swims up when I give him food, and even then he has a hard time. Its like he's swimming agenst a current! Moon Dust on the other hand goes crazy all the time! When I take the cap off the can of food she swims into the side of the tank and opens and closes her mouth. My brother has two bettas too. (though  I wish they were mine.) The girl is very fat and the boy is very skinny. The girl is named Betta and the boy is named No Name. Well, that is the basic things you do to take card of bettas.  Bye. https://www.girlscoutshcc.org/content/girlscoutshcc/en/about-girl-scouts/STEMCenter/_jcr_content/content/middle/par/image_1061672623.img.png/1505835864485.png>

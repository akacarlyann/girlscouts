<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<p><ul>
<li>President:</li>
<li>Vice President:</li>
<li>Secretary:</li></ul>
Our mission to empower girls all over the community. We focus on the values of Saint Francis High School (excellence, service, faith, and leadership) to empower our girls to serve the community.</p>

<h1>Community Service</h1>
<p>Feminine Products Drive:</p>
<p>This drive will be on ... We will be collecting feminine products to girls in Ghana who really need them. Most girls in Ghana can not afford feminine products. Instead they have to find other non-efficient, sometimes unsanitary ways to take care of the issue. One hundred percent of the items collected will go to the girls in need. </p>
<p>Women's March:</p>
<p>The march will be on January 19, 2019. Our whole club will be participating in this march. We will be making signs and wearing our club t-shirts to represent our school and our club.</p>

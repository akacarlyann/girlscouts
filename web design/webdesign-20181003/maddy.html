<h2> Types of Elements </h2>
<p> There are ten types of elements.<ol> <li> Alkali Metals: These metals behave similarly and portray similar characteristics.</li><li> Alkaline Earth Metals: These elements have a higher melting point and oxides that have basic alkaline solutions.</li><li> Lanthanides: Often called the "f-elements" due to the valence electrons in the f-shell.</li><li> Antinides: Also called the "f-elements" because of the valence in their f-shell, but Antinides are all radioactive elements. </li><li> Transition Metals: Metals that have partially filled the d-subshell. </li><li> Post-Transition Metals: These share similar characteristics to Transition Metals, but they are softer and dont conduct as well. </li><li> Metalloids: Sometimes, they behave as semiconductors rather than conductors. They are nicknamed "semi-metals" or "poor metals." </li><li> Nonmetals: </li><li> Halogens: These are subsets of Nonmetals. Halogens are normally very chemically reactive, and can be found in the environment as compounds instead of pure elements. </li><li> Noble Gases: The elements that fall into this category are very stable, and appear without color or smell. </li>
